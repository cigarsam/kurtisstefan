## Suggestions for Signaling and Geographic Preferences for Internal Medicine Residency Applications
Welcome to a helpful tool for selecting IM residencies for your applications! 
Interview selection data used from ResdidencyMatch.net (As of 01-16-25)

Take for example the combination of Signals (Gold / Silver) and Geographic Preferences. Alignment of these two preferences (eg. Silver + Geo) yields most of the interviews. However, a Gold signal may be enough to to express genuine interest irrespective of a geographic preference alignemnt, shown below. Contrast with a geographic preference alone with no signal, which appears more likely to yield a rejection.
